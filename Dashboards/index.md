## Dashboards

The **Dashboard** component is a scalable area on which you can place elements of data analysis. All elements placed on the dashboard can be related to each other or split into groups of related elements. The dashboard panel is created in the report designer and viewed in the preview panel in the report designer or viewer.

**The size of a dashboard**
When creating the dashboard in the designer, its size has a working area that looks like a white sheet with a grid. To change the size of the dashboard in the report designer, you should:
* Double-click on the working area of the dashboard;
* Specify the width and height of the dashboard in pixels. Pay attention to the fact, that there are also control commands that can be used to make the same free distance top-bottom and left right.

When you change the size of the working area of the dashboard in the report designer, the elements can stretch (shrink) or keep their size unchanged. It depends on the **Scale Content** parameter. If this option is enabled, then, when resizing the dashboard, all elements will also be stretched or shrunk. If this parameter is disabled, only the size of the working area of the dashboard will increase, while the size of the elements will remain unchanged.


The **Content Alignment** parameter allows you to define the indicator panel mode in the view area. Depending on the parameter value you select, a dashboard will be stretched in the view area, or remain unchanged. For the Content Alignment parameter, one of the following values can be set:

* **Left**, **Right**, **Center**. In this case, a dashboard will not be stretched in the viewer. The value defines only the horizontal alignment of the dashboard in the viewer area.

* **Stretch X**. In this case, a dashboard will be stretched horizontally across the entire viewer area. The height of the current dashboard can also be changed so as the aspect ratio of the dashboard will be kept.

* **Stretch XY**. In this case, a dashboard will be stretched (or shirked) across the entire area of the viewer horizontally and vertically.

> Data filtering elements of drop-down type ([combo box](Data_Filtering/Combo_Box.md), [date picker](Data_Filtering/Date_Picker.md), [tree view box](Data_Filtering/Tree_View_Box.md)) are not stretched in height.
