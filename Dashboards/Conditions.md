> **Information**
>
> All conditions are processed sequentially in the direction from top to bottom - the higher is the condition in the list, the earlier it is processed and applied. To move a condition above or below the others, you should place the cursor, hold down the left cursor button and drag the cursor up or down. See the details [how to apply the conditions](#termsofusingconditions).

**Condition parameters of Table**

For each new condition, you should specify the parameters of its applying. The color will be applied to the specific value of the selected data columns if the condition is executed.

![](../images/topics/Dashboards.Conditions_16.png)


![](../images/img_1.png) The **Field Is** parameter is used to specify the field from which the initial values will be taken: from the value field, target, series etc.

![](../images/img_2.png) The **Condition** parameter is used to specify the [condition operation](#tableofoperations). This is the operation of logical comparison of the initial value from the data field and the value from the condition.

![](../images/img_3.png) The **Value** parameter is used to specify a condition value.

![](../images/img_4.png) Format settings menu. In this menu, you should check the conditional formatting parameters that must be applied to the progress, if the condition is executed.

![](../images/img_8.png) The **Track Color** parameter allows you to define progress track color, which will be applied when a condition is executed.

**Terms of using conditions**

All conditions are processed sequentially, in the "from top to down" direction in the list of conditions. When creating multiple conditions for a single element, logical operations should be considered.


Considering the [logical operation](#tableofoperations) of the condition and the value of the condition, a range of element values is formed to which formatting will be applied. For example, a condition operation is less than, a condition value is 3. Therefore, formatting will be applied to all element values that are less than 3.


For the [example discussed bottom](#conditionparametersofchart), change the order of the conditions - move the condition of maximum values ​​(green color) above the average values ​​(yellow color).


![](../images/topics/Dashboards.Conditions_17.png)

And then, there will be no values indicated in green on the chart.


![](../images/topics/Dashboards.Conditions_18.png)

This will happen because:


**Step 1**: The report engine will analyze all the values of the selected data field;


**Step 2**: Apply a red color to all values that are less than 10,000.


**Step 3**: Apply a green color to all values that are greater than 19,000.


**Step 4**: Apply a yellow color to all values that are greater than 10,000. Values greater than 19,000 fall into the range of values of the last condition, and formatting will be applied to them.


Therefore, when using conditions in the elements of the dashboard, it is important to track the logical operations of the conditions and their order in the list of conditions.

**Table of Operations**

The list of available operations depends on the data type. Below is a list of operations for each data type and their description. The operation is performed on the value from the data field and the condition value (the value that is specified in the condition).


| **Name** | **Data Type is** **String** | **Data Type is** **Number** | **Data Type is** **Data** | **Data Type is** **Boolean** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| equal to | + | + | + | + | If the data field value is equal to the condition value, then the condition is true. |
| not equal to | + | + | + | + | If the data field value is not equal to the condition value, then the condition is true. |
| between | + | + | + |  | If the data field value is in the specific range of condition values, then the condition is true. |
| not between | + | + | + |  | If the data field value is not in the specific range of condition values, then the condition is true. |
| greater than | + | + | + |  | If the data field value is greater then the condition value, then the condition is true. |
| greater than or equal to | + | + | + |  | If the data field value is greater then the condition value of equal to the filter value, then the condition is true. |
| less than | + | + | + |  | If the data field value is less then the condition value, then the condition is true. |
| less then or equal to | + | + | + |  | If the data field value is less then the condition value of equal to the filter value, then the condition is true. |
| containing | + |  |  |  | If the data field value contains the condition value, then the condition is true. |
| not containing | + |  |  |  | If the data field value does not contain the condition value, then the condition is true. |
| beginning with | + |  |  |  | If the data field value starts with the condition value, then the condition is true. |
| ending with | + |  |  |  | If the data field value ends with the condition value, then the condition is true. |
| is blank | + |  |  |  | If the data field value is blank, then the condition is true. |
| is not blank | + |  |  |  | If the data field value is not blank, then the condition is true. |
| is null | + | + | + |  | If the data field value is null, then the condition is true. |
| in not null | + | + | + |  | If the data field value is not null, then the condition is true. |
