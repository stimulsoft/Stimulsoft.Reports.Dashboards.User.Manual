## Cards

Cards is a data analytics element, which allows you to display grouped values of data fields as a card.

In this chapter the following questions will be considered:

* [Element editor](#editor);

* [Card Layout](#ordertocreatecards);

* [The order of displaying values in cards](#ordertooutputvalues);

* [The order of displaying cards in an element](#ordertooutputincards);

* [The color of cards background](#backcolor);

* [Table of Properties](#propertiestable).


You can display on cards:

* Values from data fields and a graphic analysis applied to them;
* Manually specified value;

* Images from data fields.


Values display of the **Cards** element is customized in its editor and using properties. To call the editor, you should:
* Double click on the **Cards** element;
* Select the **Cards** element, and choose the **Design** command in the context menu.


**Element Editor**
In the editor of the **Cards** element, you can add fields with data, the order of their display in each card, deletion and enable of different types of graphic data analysis.

![](../images/img_2.png) The **Expression** field of a selected data field.

![](../images/img_3.png) Value type of the selected data filed:

* The **Dimension** is the type at which the value of the data field will be displayed in its initial state.

* The **Measure** indicator is the type in which various functions can be applied to the values of the data field.
* The **Data Bars** is the type in which various functions can be applied to the values of a data field, and a Data Bars will be added for each value of this field.
* The **Color Scale** is the type in which various functions can be applied to the values of a data field, and a color scale will be added for each value of this field.
* The **Indicator** is the type in which various functions can be applied to the values of a data field, and an indicator will be added for each value of this field.
* The **Sparklines** is the type in which a value of a data field will be presented as a graphic. By the way, in this case, the sparkline has several views – graphic, area, data bars, win/lose. In addition, you can define the mode of starting points for sparkline, graphic or area.

* The **Bubble** is the type in which various functions can be applied to the values of a data field, and each value will be presented as a bubble.

![](../images/img_4.png) The **Visible** parameter allows you to enable or disable the display of a selected column in a element of a dashboard. Also, enable or disable of a column can depended on the result of a logic expression. If the result of expression calculation will be the true value, a column will be enabled. If the result of expression calculation will be the false value, the column will be disabled.


In cases, if such types of graphic analysis as **Color Scale**, **Sparkline**, **Bubble** are used for data fields, other parameters, which allow you to define additional settings of these types will be displayed in the editor.

**Card Layout**

When adding the first data field to the **Cards** element, for each value from a data column will be formed its own card. Next, if another data column will be added from the same source, its values will be added to existing cards as well as these data is compared in the source.


![](../images/topics/Dashboards.Cards_5.png)

If a data column will be added from another data source, its values will be added to existing cards if there is a connection between data sources. Otherwise, if there is no connection between data sources, for values from the second column data column will be formed their own cards.


**The order of displaying values in the cards**

Each value from a data column, by default, it is displayed in a new row. The order of displaying values in rows of a card is defined by the location of fields in the **Cards** element editor. This way, the higher a data column, the higher a value from it in the card.


![](../images/topics/Dashboards.Cards_6.png)


If you need to display a value from the following data column in the same row as the previous one, you should use the **Wrap Line** property and set to the **False** value. After that, the values from the data column which is located in the element editor below will be displayed in the card of the same row.


**The order of displaying cards in the element**

The order of displaying cards in the element is defined by the following element properties: **Column Count** and **Orientation**. By default, the **Column Count** property is set to 0 value, i.e. the number of columns in the element to display cards is calculated automatically. However, you can change it, having specified the necessary number of columns as a value of this property.


![](../images/topics/Dashboards.Cards_7.png)

The direction of cards columns filling depends on a value of the **Orientation** property and by default is defined as **Horizontal**, i.e. cards are displayed from left to right line by line.


![](../images/topics/Dashboards.Cards_8.png)

However, the **Orientation** property can be defined as the Vertical, i.e. firstly cards will be filled with from top to bottom, after in the next right column.


![](../images/topics/Dashboards.Cards_9.png)


**Cards Back Color**
By default, cards back color in the element and the element back color are defined from the **Back Color** property. The value for this property can be received from the element style or defined from the **Back Color** property. However, each card can have its own shade. It depends on the value of the **Color Each** property. If the **Color Each** property is set to the True value, each card will have a unique shade.


![](../images/topics/Dashboards.Cards_10.png)

Color sets for creating shades depend on a value of the **Series Colors** property and can be received from a style of the element or defined from preset color collections in the list of values of this property.
