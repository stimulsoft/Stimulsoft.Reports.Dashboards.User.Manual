## Tree View

**Tree View** is a filtering element on the dashboard, which is used to create a hierarchy of values and filter data for analysis in the viewer by these values. It can be located anywhere on the dashboard panel. Depending on the size of the dashboard in the viewer, it can grow and shrink by height and width.

This chapter will cover the following:

* [Tree View editor](#TreeViewEditor);

* [Table Of Properties](#TableOfProperties).


The **Tree View** can be subordinate to other filtering elements, or be the main filtering element for them. The **Tree View** can work in two selection modes:

* **One**. In the viewer, you can select only one value within one level of the hierarchy of values. Accordingly, data filtering for the elements of the dashboard will be performed only by one value.

* **Multi**. In the viewer, you can select multiple values within the same level of the hierarchy of values. Accordingly, data filtering for the elements of the dashboard will be performed by all selected values.

You may setup the **Tree View** element in the editor. To call the editor, you should do the following in the report designer:

* Double-click the **Tree View** element;

* Select the **Tree View** element and select the **Design** command in the context menu.

> The search string for elements will be displayed automatically, if the number of values of the element will be 10.

![](../../images/img_2.png) The **Field** field. Displays the expression of the selected item data field.

![](../../images/img_3.png) The **Selection Mode** parameter. Specifies the number of simultaneously selected values of the element. A **Tree View** is one element or many elements.

![](../../images/img_4.png) The **Show (All) Value** option. Enables the option to select all values in the **Tree View** element. If this option is enabled, the **Select (All) Value** value will be present in the Tree View element.

![](../../images/img_5.png) The Show Blanks parameter allows you to display or not to display blank values from a data source in the list of the values of the current element.

![](../../images/img_6.png) The **Parent Element** parameter. It is used to define the main filtering element for the current element. The data of these filter elements will be interrelated, and depending on the selected value of the main element, the list of values of the current element will be filtered.
