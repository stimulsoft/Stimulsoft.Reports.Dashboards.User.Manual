## Sorting

Read the following in this chapter:

* [Sorting in a Table;](#datasortingintable)

* [Sorting in a Chart](#datasortinginchart);

* [Sorting in an Indicator](#datasortinginindicator);

* [Sorting in a Progress](#datasortinginprogress);

* [Sorting in a Gauge](#datasortingingauge).

When designing an analytical panel, you often need to sort data. You can do this in the following ways:

* Create a sorted data source that will be used for elements of the dashboard;

* [Sort data in data transformation](Data_Filtering/Data_Transformation.md#DTSorting);

* Sort data in each item.


Sorting data in an element can be:

* Preset, customized when you design the dashboard panel;

* Interactive, when the user is viewing the dashboard panel, he/she can change the sorting options.

* [Chart](Chart.md);

* [Table](Table.md);

* [Indicator](Indicator.md);

* [Progress](Progress.md);

* [Gauge](Gauge.md).

Sorting in a Table
