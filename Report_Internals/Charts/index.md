Chart is a data visualization tool used in a report. With this tool, data is processed, and the results are displayed using graphical elements.


The type of chart depends on the type of chart series. A single series represents the values of one data column, except in cases where multiple values are required to display graphical elements. For example, financial charts require four values to render a single graphical element.
Thus, a single Chart component can display multiple chart series. In this case, the series types are the same, but the data differs. However, some series types are compatible with others. For instance, a Histogram and a Line can be displayed within the same Chart component.


> **Information**
>
> The following series types are compatible with each other:
> * Histogram, Line, Spline, Step Line, Area, Spline Area, Step Area.
>
> * Stacked Histogram, Stacked Line, Stacked Spline, Stacked Area, Stacked Spline Area.
>
> * Normalized Histogram, Normalized Line, Normalized Spline, Normalized Area, Normalized Spline Area.

Chart series data can be:
* Obtained from data sources;
* Entered manually.


To add a Chart component to a report, follow these steps:
* In the Infographics menu on the toolbox or the Insert tab of the designer’s Ribbon panel, select a chart type.
* Click the desired location in the report with the left mouse button.


Next, resize the Chart component and configure it in the component editor. To open the Chart component editor:

* Double-click the Chart component in the report;
* Open the context menu of the Chart component and select the Design command.


Chart Editor
The chart and its elements are configured in the editor using properties. All properties are grouped on specific tabs based on the chart element they belong to. Additionally, properties within each tab are grouped by purpose, with each group represented as a separate section.

Each tab in the editor includes:
* A chart preview panel with property groups;
* A properties panel;
* Additionally, some tabs may display extra panels when selected.

All tabs and their property groups will be covered in the following sections:
* Chart;
* Series;

* Area;
* Labels;
* Styles.


The table below lists chart series types with brief descriptions.

Series

Description


Clustered Column:

![](../../images/topics/Report_Internals.Charts_1.png)

Clustered Column

Displays values for a specific argument. In histograms, graphical elements are arranged along the horizontal axis, while values are plotted on the vertical axis.

![](../../images/topics/Report_Internals.Charts_2.png)

Stacked Column

Shows the proportion of values from different series for a specific argument. Each value represents a segment of the graphical element.

![](../../images/topics/Report_Internals.Charts_3.png)

Full-Stacked Column

Displays the relative share of each value as a percentage of the total for a given argument.

![](../../images/ClusteredColumn3D.png)

3D Clustered Column
A three-dimensional version of a standard histogram with data represented as 3D columns, highlighting categories on an additional axis.

![](../../images/StackedColumn3D.png)

3D Stacked Column

Similar to a 3D Clustered Column but includes segments representing each category's contribution to the total.

![](../../images/FullStackedColumn3D.png)

3D Full-Stacked Column

A stacked column normalized to 100%, showing proportions between categories.


Line:

![](../../images/topics/Report_Internals.Charts_4.png)

Line

Line and line with markers are used to indicate individual data values, line charts are useful to show trends over time or ordered categories, especially when there are many data points and the order in which they are presented is important.

![](../../images/topics/Report_Internals.Charts_5.png)

Stacked Line

Displayed with or without markers to indicate individual data values, stacked line charts are useful to show the trend of the contribution of each value over time or ordered categories. If there are many categories or the values are approximate, you should use a stacked line chart without markers.

![](../../images/topics/Report_Internals.Charts_6.png)

Full-Stacked Line

This is a kind of the Line series by which you can compare the relative proportion of each value of the series among the total aggregate value of specific arguments. Lines without markers are recommended in the approximation of the set of value arguments.

![](../../images/topics/Report_Internals.Charts_7.png)

Spline

This type of series is used to display a smooth line, the points of which are the values of the series. Each point has its coordinates depending on the value and argument of the chart series. After all points are specified, a spline will be drawn. Points on the chart can be displayed using markers. Spline without markers is recommended in the approximation of the set of value arguments.

![](../../images/topics/Report_Internals.Charts_8.png)

Stacked Spline

This type of series is used to display a smooth line, the points of which are the values ​​of the series. Each point has its coordinates depending on the value and argument of the chart series. The points of the next row of the chart are located above the smooth line of the previous row of the chart. After all points are specified, a stacked spline will be drawn. Points on the chart can be displayed using markers. Smooth lines without markers are recommended for the approximation of the set of value arguments.

![](../../images/topics/Report_Internals.Charts_9.png)

Full-Stacked Spline

This is a variety of Spline series, with which you can compare the relative proportion of each value of a series in the total aggregate value of specific arguments. Smooth lines without markers are recommended in the approximation of the set of value arguments.

![](../../images/topics/Report_Internals.Charts_10.png)

Stepped Line

Pie:

![](../../images/topics/Report_Internals.Charts_11.png)

Pie

Pie charts display the contribution of each value to a total. It is possible to manually pull out the slices of a pie chart to emphasize them.

This is a type of linear series. In the chart area, points are marked by coordinates - the value and argument of the series. Then, strictly vertical and horizontal lines pass through these points. The area between the line and the axis of the arguments is filled with color.


Range:

![](../../images/topics/Report_Internals.Charts_24.png)

Range

The chart type Range can be used to display the interval of values ​​per unit of time or period of time. To build such a diagram you should have start and end values​​.
