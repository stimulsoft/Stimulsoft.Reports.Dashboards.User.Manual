## KeyDataColumn Property


The **Hierarchical** **band** has the **KeyDataColumn** property. This property is required for filling. If the **KeyDataColumn** is not specified, the report generator will not be able to render a report. The value of this property can be any data column from the selected **Hierarchical** **band** of the data source, which entries will be keys for creating a report. For example, if the **Employees** data source is specified to the **Hierarchical** **band**, then the value of the **KeyDataColumn** property is the **EmployeesID** data column, because the entry of this column is the key and contains unique codes of employees.
