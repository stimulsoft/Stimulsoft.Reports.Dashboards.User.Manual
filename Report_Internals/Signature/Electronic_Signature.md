## Electronic Signature

This component is used to graphically sign a report. The following can be used as an electronic signature:

* Drawing initials and full name with different styles;

* Signature style, text, image, or their combinations.


Electronic signature settings can be found in the component editor and using the [component properties](#tableofproperties). To call the editor:

* Double click on the Electronic Signature component;

* Select the Signature component and select the Design command from the context menu.

The general algorithm for adding a signature is as follows:

* Call the editor;

* Define the signature parameters in the [Type](#type) or [Draw](#draw) tab;

* Click the Save button in the component editor. The Sign command will be instead of the Save command if the report will be signing in the viewer.

**Sign of the report**

When adding the Electronic Signature component to a report, you can change the signature when viewing the report. To do this, go to the viewer, load a report with a signature and select the Sign command on the viewer toolbar. If the report uses several Electronic Signature components, they should be edited separately. To do this, call the component editor using the Sign command and use the Next and Back buttons to move between the signed components.


> **Information**
>
> Please note that if the Sign command is not displayed on the viewer toolbar, then it should be enabled in the report template [preview settings](../../Reports_Designer/Template/Preview_Settings.md).

The Sign command will become unavailable on the toolbar after a report has be signed in the viewer. The report can only be verified once.
Report re-sign in the viewer

You can set the Allow Clear Signature property of the component to True in the report designer if you would to have the ability for removing report signature in the viewer. After that, you can remove report signature in the viewer using Clear Signature command from the context menu.

Component Editor

Each electronic signature mode is presented on a separate tab and contains specific settings. In addition, the component editor has control elements - save signature and list of signatures.

![](../../images/img_2.png) Signature in the Draw mode provides the ability to use an image, text, signature style, or their combinations.

![](../../images/img_3.png) The Save command provides the ability to add a signature to the list of saved signatures.

![](../../images/img_4.png) A menu that contains a list of previously saved signatures. When hovering over an item in the list of saved labels, the Delete control will also be displayed clicking on which, the signature will be removed from the list.

Electronic signature parameters of the Type mode

In this mode, you can specify the full spelling of the name and initials, and then determine the writing style.

![](../../images/img_1.png) A field in which you can specify the full name.

![](../../images/img_2.png) A field in which you can specify initials.

![](../../images/img_3.png) A menu that contains a list of styles for displaying the signature.

![](../../images/img_4.png) The field in which the thumbnail of the signature is displayed.


In order to draw a signature, you should do the following in the component editor in the Type tab:

* Enter a value in the Full Name and/or Initials fields;

* Click the Change style;

* Select a font for drawing the signature.

Electronic signature parameters in the Draw mode

In this mode, you can draw a signature, specify its text, image, or combine these methods.

> **Information**
>
> Please note that the signature sketch field contains a horizontal line as a separator. Everything above this line is the signature area. Everything below is the description area, which can be changed using the Description properties. Also, an icon is displayed in the signature area. It displays the state of the signature. If the icon is displayed, the final signing of the report has not been completed when viewing it. To determine the status of the icon display, as well as its configuration, you may use the properties of the component.

Adding a signature in the Draw mode

Do the next steps to draw a signature, in the component editor, in the Draw tab:

* Select a brush color by clicking the down arrow control next to Use Brush;

* Click on Use Brush;

* In the area of the signature thumbnail, hold down the left button of the mouse;

* Draw a signature keeping the button pressed.

* After that, if necessary, add an image and text to the signature.
