## PDF Element

The PDF Element is a component that, when exporting a report to a PDF file, places a standard digital signature for the PDF document at its location. The signature is applied using a certificate, which must be selected in the export settings.


> **Information**
>
> In the export settings menu, the certificate can only be selected from the Windows certificate store using the system UI. When exporting via code, you can still use the UI, but it’s also possible to search for a certificate by its *SubjectNameString* or pass the certificate directly to the export process as a byte array using StiPdfExportSettings.

If no certificate is specified, the component functions as a PDF Digital Signature, adding an interactive element for signing with Adobe Acrobat tools.


Stimulsoft's export to the PDF format supports signing a document with only one certificate. Therefore, if the report contains more than one PDF Element component, only the first one will be considered the signature field for the certificate. All other components will function as PDF Digital Signature, providing an interactive signing element for Adobe Acrobat.

Configuration of the PDF Element is performed through:

* The component editor, where the type of signature and its parameters can be selected;

* The properties list of this component.


To open the editor:
* Double-click on the PDF Element component;
* Select the PDF Element component and choose the Design command from the context menu.

Component Editor

The editor contains the signature type selector Type and a group of Labels parameters, which determine what information from the certificate will be added to the PDF document's digital signature. Additionally, depending on the type of signature, an optional Objects field may be available.

* The Objects field is available only if the signature type is set to Image or Draw.

* If the type is Image, the Objects field allows you to upload an image using the Open control or delete it using the Remove command.

* If the type is Draw, the Objects field lets you draw a signature. To draw, press and hold the left mouse button and create the graphical signature.


* The Labels group contains parameters that determine what information from the certificate will be added to the digital signature. If a parameter checkbox is selected, the corresponding information from the certificate will be added to the digital signature. If no parameters are selected, no textual information will be added to the signature.

Properties Table

The table provides a list of the components properties.
