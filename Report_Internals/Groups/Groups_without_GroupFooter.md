## Groups Without A GroupFooter


In grouped reports is is usual to display both a group header and a group footer. However, what if you need to output only group headers without group footers?


It is possible to simply not include a **Group Footer**, but this is **NOT** recommended as it can lead to unexpected results particularly if you are working with **Nested** groups.  It is, therefore, recommended that you **ALWAYS** use **Group Headers** and **Group Footers** in pairs.


* **Important:** To render reports with grouping you should always use Group Headers and Group Footers in pairs to avoid the possibility of unexpected results.


If you do not want the **Group Footer** to be displayed it can be hidden by setting its height to **0** which will cause the report to be rendered successfully but the band will not appear in the output.
