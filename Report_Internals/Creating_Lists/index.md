## Creating Lists


Lists in a report can be output using three bands: **Header**

, **Footer**

, and **Data**

. Data are output using these bands. The basic band is the **Data** band. A data source is specified to each **Data** band. The data source is a table. Each data source has data fields. It is possible to output a table by placing text components with references to these fields. One data source can specify previously unknown number of rows with data. The **Data** band is output as many times as there are rows in the specified data source. For example, if there are 100 rows in the data source, then the **Data** bad will be output 100 times. If it is not enough space on one page, the second page will be generated and printing will be continued. Using the **Header** band, headers will be added to the table that is output using the **Data** band. Correspondingly, the **Footer** band is used to output different totals by the output table.
