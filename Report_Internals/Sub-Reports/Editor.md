Parameters are usually used to filter data or transfer information from the main report to a sub-report. To add a parameter, you should:

* Call the editor of the sub-report;

* Go to the **Parameters** tab;

* Click the **Add** **button**;

* Specify the name of the parameter and its expression.


In the parameter expression, you can specify:

* The data column;

* Variable;

* Any other expression.


After that, you should go to the resource of the **Sub-Report** component (a page or another report) and specify this parameter, for example, in the filter expression.
