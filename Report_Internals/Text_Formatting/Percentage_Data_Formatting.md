## Percentage Data Formatting


If the report uses the relative values, the current data can be output as a percentage text format. Consider the example of a report with relative values. Let's have a report that contains a list of products (standard format), their price (currency format) and the profitability index (number format).

Now let's add a column with profitability. In this case, the profitability is the ratio as a percentage value. To do this, add the text component on the right with the reference to the Products.ProfitabilityIndex column and set the format as percent for this text component. The header of this column will be Profitability.

It should be noted that previously there were two ways to determine the format mask:

* Use local settings, the text is formatted according to the current settings of the operating system.

* Each parameter is defined by the format mask manually.


Sometimes there were some disadvantages in both cases. For example, when using local settings to change the format parameters you should edit formats of the operating system. In the second case, when it is needed to change one parameter you should adjust others as well. Considering disadvantages of these methods, there is a third way to determine the format. Using the local settings you can change any parameter format. To do this, set the flag next to the parameter and set its value.
