## Grid Lines Right Horizontal

**Grid Lines Horizontal Right** are lines in the chart area corresponding to each value of the right Y-axis, running parallel to the X-axis. In other words, a line of a specific style and color will extend from each value of the right Y-axis to the opposite edge of the chart area, parallel to the X-axis.
