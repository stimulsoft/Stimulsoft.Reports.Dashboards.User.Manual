## Trend Line

One of the options for data analysis and forecasting is the ability to overlay a trendline on a chart. Depending on the type, the trendline allows displaying the dependence of the series values on its arguments. A trendline can be applied to non-accumulating series, bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, and bubble charts.
