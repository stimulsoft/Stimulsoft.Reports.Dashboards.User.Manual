## Line Marker

A Line Marker is a graphical symbol used to display intermediate values along a line between the nearest series values. Line markers are available only for line-based charts, including Line, Area, Range, and their variations.

To apply line markers to a chart series, follow these steps:
* In the component editor, go to the Series tab and open the Line Marker section;
* Configure the line marker’s appearance using its properties.


> **Information**

> If a style is applied to the chart, the line marker’s appearance settings will be inherited from that style. Before customizing the line marker in the Line Marker tab, set the Allow Apply Style property to False in the Common tab.

Below is a table of properties that are used to configure the line marker.
