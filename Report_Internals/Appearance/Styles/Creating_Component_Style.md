## Component Style

The **Component** Style is applied to all report components that do not have a specific style. For example, for bands, text components, panels, images, etc. To create a component style, do the following:

* Click the **Add Style** button in the **Style Designer** and select the **Component** style.

* Configure the formatting settings using the style properties.

* Apply the style to [report components](index.md#applystyle) or [dashboard elements](../../../Dashboards/Appearance.md#ApplyStyle).
