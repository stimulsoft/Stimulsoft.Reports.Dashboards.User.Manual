## Report Control Style

The **Report Control** style applies to forms and controls in a report, as well as to [filter elements](../../../Dashboards/Data_Filtering/index.md) and the [Button](../../../Dashboards/Button.md) element in the dashboard. To create a style for a control, you should do the following:

* Use the style properties to customize the formatting.

* Apply the style to the [report components](index.md#applystyle) or [dashboard elements](../../../Dashboards/Appearance.md#ApplyStyle).
