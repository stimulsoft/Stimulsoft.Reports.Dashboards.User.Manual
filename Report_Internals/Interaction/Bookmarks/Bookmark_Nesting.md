## Bookmark Nesting


Nesting depends on which components generated bookmarks. For example, the page bookmark will always be one level higher then other bookmarks. The bookmark, created with the **Group Header** **band**, is one level higher then the bookmark, created by the **Data** band, in this group. In the Master-Detail relation the Master bookmark will enable all Detail bookmarks. For example, we have a report with a group.


**Group**

--Data 1

--Data 2

--Data 3

**Group**

--Data 1

--Data 2

--Data 3


In this report groups include data. And bookmarks from the group will include bookmarks from data. As a result we get the same structure in the tree of bookmark. For example:


**Group 1**

--**Group 2**

----Data 1

----Data 2

----Data 3


**Group 1**

--**Group 2**

----Data 1

----Data 2

----Data 3


In the tree of bookmarks two nodes will be created. They are **Group 1**, **Group 1**. Each of these nodes will include the **Group 2** node. The **Group 2** nodes will include the **data** nodes. For example, the Master-Detail report:


**Master-Data**

--Data 1

--Data 2

--Data 3

**Master-Data**

--Data 1

--Data 2

--Data 3


In this example the nodes of the Master band form the Master-Data nodes. Each of these nodes will include nodes formed with the Detail band.
