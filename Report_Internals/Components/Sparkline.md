## Sparkline

The Sparkline component is a visual tool to display data. Unlike charts, a sparkline does not contain data values, axis labels, legend, and other elements.

To add a sparkline to the report, you should do the following:

* Select the Sparkline component on the Toolbox or the Insert tab in the Components group;

* Place this component on the report page or the Data band.


> **Information**
>
> When placing the Sparkline component on the Data band, you should specify the relationship between their data sources. You can do this using the Data Relation property of the Sparkline component.

A sparkline in reports can be of the following type:

* Line - the values of the specified data column will be displayed as a line graph;

* Area - the values of the specified data column will be displayed as an area;

* Column - the values of the specified data column will be displayed as a column chart;

* Win/Loss - the values of the specified data column will be displayed as positive and negative blocks.


You may configure the Sparkline component the following way:

* [In the component editor](#editor) (double-click on the current component in the report).

* Using the [properties of the component](#tableofproperties). Select the component in the report and change the required values on the Property panel.

The Sparkline editor

In the editor of the current component, the component is visually configured.

![](../../images/img_1.png) The Value field specifies the data column, based on the values ​​of which the sparkline is created.

![](../../images/img_2.png) In the current field, you can change the data column for the sparkline values.

![](../../images/img_3.png) The Type field contains controls that you can use to change the type of sparkline.

![](../../images/img_4.png) The High/Low Points parameter is used to display the maximum and minimum value markers on a Line or Area sparkline.

![](../../images/img_5.png) The First/Last Points parameter is used to display the first and last value markers on a sparkline of the Line or Area type.

![](../../images/img_6.png) The Color parameter is used to change the color of the sparkline. You can specify the color of positive and negative values for a sparkline of Column or Win/Loss types.

The list of properties
