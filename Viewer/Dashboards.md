## Dashboards

The report viewer in the view mode for dashboard panels differs from the report viewer in the report view mode. The dashboard panel and its elements are stretched to the entire area of the viewer. Elements of the dashboard panel - [Combo Box](../Dashboards/Data_Filtering/Combo_Box.md), [Date Picker](../Dashboards/Data_Filtering/Date_Picker.md), [Tree View Box](../Dashboards/Data_Filtering/Tree_View_Box.md) are stretched only in width. Besides, the dashboard and its elements contain various control buttons.
