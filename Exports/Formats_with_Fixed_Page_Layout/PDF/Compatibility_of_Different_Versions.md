## Compatibility of Different Versions


The information below shows the compatibility of Adobe Acrobat versions.


**Adobe Acrobat 5:**

**Adobe Acrobat 5 & 6:**

* when editing Adobe Acrobat does not recognize the Unicode - only Latin characters are output (Latin-1 encoding), other characters are output as dots;

* if the "**UseUnicode**" option in export parameters is enabled, then it is necessary to embed fonts (the "**Embedded Fonts**" option), otherwise the will be output incorrectly.


**Adobe Acrobat 7:**

* it is necessary to embed fonts to the PDF file. Otherwise, when editing, any font will be replaced on the default font (usually on Tahoma).
