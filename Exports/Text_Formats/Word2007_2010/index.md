Later there was a release for Apple Macintosh (1984), SCO UNIX, and Microsoft Windows (1989). Microsoft Word is the most popular text processors. Starting with first versions MS Word could write files in binary code with the «.doc» extension. The Word specification was secret and only in 2008 was published.

This format is a zip-archive that contains a text as XML, graphics, and other data. When exporting, a report is converted into one table. Such a document is easy to edit.
