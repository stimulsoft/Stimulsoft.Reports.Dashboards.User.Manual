## Export Dashboard

When viewing the dashboard in the report viewer, you can convert its elements to [PDF](#pdfexportsettings), [Excel files](#excelexportsettings), as well as [image](#imageexportsettings) files such as BMP, GIF, PNG, TIFF, JPEG, PCX, EMF, SVG, and SVGZ. In addition, you can save the dashboard as a [report snapshot](#reportsnapshot).

To export the dashboard, click the [More Options](../Viewer/Dashboards.md#moreoptions) button and select the appropriate command. If you want to convert only a specific element, click the [Save](../Viewer/Dashboards.md#save) button on that element and select the file type.

> For the [Table](../Dashboards/Table.md) element, export formats to [CSV, DBF, XML, JSON, DIF, and SYLK](#exportsettingsofdata) are also available. To do this, select the **Data** command in the **Save** menu. Then, in the export settings, select the file type into which you want to convert the current element.

After selecting the export format, the export options dialog will be called. The parameters may vary depending on the type. Let's consider export settings in more detail.
