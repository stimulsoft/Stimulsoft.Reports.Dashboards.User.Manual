The type of the data source depends on the type of connection. When using this command, a wizard to create a new data source that provides the ability to add more than one data table in a data dictionary of a report. It is necessary to know that this is just a method of describing the data source.

It should be remembered that for each created business object, you must pass real business objects from the program. Since, as already mentioned before, only a method of describing data is created in the data dictionary. So, without real business objects, it will not work.;

It is worth to note that relations can be created only between data sources and cannot be created between business objects. Therefore, if needed to create the relation between business objects, the **RegData** method should be used instead of the **RegBusinessObjects** method. The **RegData** method converts the business object into the ADO.NET DataSet. As a result, you can work with this business object by means of ADO.NET.

Such a category can be created with this command.

If, when calling this command, any category of variables has been selected in the data dictionary, then the variable will be created in this category. If no category in the data dictionary has been selected or the Variable element has been selected in the data dictionary, then the new variable will be created at the top level of the variables list.
