## Limitations in Creating Relations

When creating or using relations between data sources, the following restrictions are:


* Selected data sources (parent and child) must be of the same type, i.e. types relations should be identical. If the types relations are different, then you can use the **CashAllData** property.

* **Name** must be present and correct, in terms of **C#** or **VB.NET** compiler. If the name is reserved in the source, you must add the **@** symbol before the relation name. For example, **@relation**.

* Column-keys must comply with all rules of creation a relation to **ADO.NET**:

![](../../../../images/fly.png) Their types must match, so if the primary column-key of the **String** type, then the child column-key must be of the **String** type;

![](../../../../images/fly.png) Keys must be specified, so the relation cannot be created without keys.
