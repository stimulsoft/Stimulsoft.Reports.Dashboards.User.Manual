Step 2: [Go to the data dictionary](Install_and_First_Run.md#reportdesigneroverview);


Step 3: [Connect data](Connecting_Data.md);

Step 5: Using the drop-down lists, identify the master and detail data sources;


> **Information**
>
> The selected data sources (master and detail) must be of the same type, connection types must be the same. If the connection types are different, then you can use the CashAllData property.


Step 6: Select the data columns using which the relation between the sources will be arranged. Hold down the Ctrl button to select multiple columns.

> **Information**
>
> When creating a connection, you should know that the key columns must comply with all the rules for creating a connection in ADO.NET:
>
> * Their number should be the same;
>
> * Their types must match, if the master key column is the string type, then the detail key column must be the string type;
>
> * Keys must be specified, keyless relation is impossible.

Step 7: Select the Active Relation. If the data source has several relations with other sources, then an active relation will be used to map the data.
