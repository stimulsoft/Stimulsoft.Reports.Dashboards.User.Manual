## Invoice Report

The invoice is most often used in accounting for the tax (customs) control or in the international supply of goods. This document usually includes the cost of transportation, shipping operations, insurance, payment of export duties, as well as various taxes (fees), and more. If your activity requires constant creation of invoices, for optimization, time and cost savings, it is logical to assume that it is easier to create a document template. Using it, you change only the data, saving yourself from routine work to create the structure of the invoice and its design.

You can create templates and tools in many ways, but I want to help you save time in finding these resources. In this tutorial you will learn how to quickly create an invoice template, decorate it and get the finished document. This will take you some time. I will try as much as possible to describe in detail the process of creating such a report.
